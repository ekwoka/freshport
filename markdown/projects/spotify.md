### Custom Spotify Webapp

This is my attempt at recreating Spotify but with some (imho improved) UI/UX as well as extend it with additional features.

Design is inspired by design from Behanced:
Mobile: [SPOTIFY REDESIGN by Heba Zatar](https://www.behance.net/gallery/110213585/SPOTIFY-REDESIGN-UIUX-DESIGN-FREE)
Desktop: [Spotify by Thalia Brittanie](https://www.behance.net/gallery/96546951/Spotify)

This project is built on top of a custom scaffold I put together I call a [PETT App](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ekwoka/create-pett-app).

At the core is Preact (a lightweight React alternative) coupled with some custom utilities and Spotify-web-playback to enable a powerful experience.

This is complemented by esBuild for ðŸ”¥ BLAZINGLY FAST ðŸ”¥ build times. So fast there isn't a need for a special dev server.

#### Unique Features

The most obvious differences are in the UI, as this isn't simply a Spotify Clone, however, the differences don't have to stop there.

The main basis for extending Spotify beyond simply a cosmetic redesign is to improve the social experience to music and podcasts. Being able to more easily and organically share music with those closest to you and discover new music through your network.

> Note: This project is still a work in progress and is not accessible by users that have not been manually approved. This is a restriction imposed by Spotify. For access, just message me!
