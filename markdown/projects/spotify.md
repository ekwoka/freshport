---
This is my attempt at recreating Spotify but with some (imho improved) UI/UX as well as extend it with additional features.

This project is built on top of a custom scaffold I put together I call a [PETT App](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ekwoka/create-pett-app).

At the core is Preact (a lightweight React alternative) coupled with some custom utilities and the Spotify API and Web Playback SDKs to enable a powerful native-like experience.

This is complemented by esBuild for 🔥 BLAZINGLY FAST 🔥 build times. So fast there isn't a need for a special dev server.

> Note: This project is still a work in progress and is not accessible by users that have not been manually approved. This is a restriction imposed by Spotify. For access, just message me!
