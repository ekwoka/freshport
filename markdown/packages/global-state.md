This is a rewrite of `preact-global-state` to add types, improve support for ESM modules, and also give `useGlobalState` more feature parity with the Preact `useState` hook.

This allows you to share state between multiple components, similar to `useContext` or even `redux` but at a simpler and more focussed level.
